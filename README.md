# Portfolio-Website

This Portfolio Project had the target to show a Website that show our skills and a couple of projects we did in the past. The Objective was open and no further instruction was given. 

I did chose a simple desigen with a focus on who I am and what I plan to do. I chose to place a picture dominant so its a eye catcher. 

I used JS twice in the project, once to open and close pictures of my projects, This should help to prevent making the page to busy, while also demonstrating some simple JS usage. 

I also used it on the contact side to open a contact Form should the visitor click on the Email symbole.
